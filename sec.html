      Hey everyone Shounak here , serving as the Secretary General . 
      I'm done with science so here I am with muns as a back up career option.
       My greatest achievements include winning best del in committee despite 
       being suspended  from committee. While i might not be able to promise 
       you a best del award , I can defintely promise a great experience at 
       one of the most amazing conferences in Dubai.

      Hey! I am Divya Agrawal, one of the few commerce kids on this team. 
      Debating has been and is quite literally the best part of any conference
       for me in any competition, which is what initially drew me towards MUNs. 
       However, aside from debating, I am often recognized as a swiftie and enjoy
        reading books and eating (other people's food). I am super excited for 
        Earth Ignite23' and cannot wait to meet and work with new people! That's 
        all from your Secretary General... live laugh love food.

      Hello! My name is Amritha Anil and I'm honored to be the USG of 
      Administration for Earth Ignite . I hope that everyone will keep 
      in mind that if we continue to raise toasts to the fog even on clear 
      days then we'll end up missing the sunlight that's looking to fall upon 
      us. So as we discuss crucial topics that affect our entire generation , let's
       continue to keep hope alight in our hearts amidst the search for solutions.
          Let's all look towards brighter skies!

      Hello everyone! I'm Neha and I'll be serving as the USG of Volunteers for IHS's Earth Ignite 23'.
       With my interest in politics and public speaking, especially debate, it was only natural that I 
       would gravitate towards MUNs. This journey that started back in 8th grade has finally brought me 
       here, where I hope to see our brilliant chairs and delegates make the conference come alive with 
       their inquisitiveness and of course, their passion to go head to head and debate as much as they can.
        I hope we can all leave having had an unforgettable experience, and possibly new insights to many
         things that'll make us better prepared for the future to come.

    <h1>Crisis Director<br><span>Vibhali Rao</span></h1>
    <p><br>
      Hello, I'm Vibhali Rao from 11 Commerce and I am honoured to serve 
      the role of USG Crisis Director for the Second Edition of Earth Ignite 
      Summit which will be held in Indian High School, Oud Maitha in November 2023. 
      My public speaking journey began in the 7th grade and although my 
      first two MUNs were scary and confusing, I was determined to learn
       more and eager to win some accolades in the future. I went on to 
       participate in many more MUNs and public speaking competitions like
        the First Edition of this years Earth Ignite Summit and also chaired in an MUN last year. 
      I encourage you all to participate in this conference, not just for the
       university credits but also for the thrilling and fun experience that it 
       offers. Events like these challenge you to speak confidently and research
        thoroughly and also provide you with the opportunity to show off your diplomacy
         skills, share your opinions on world affairs, roast other countries 
         (while adhering to decorum, of course) and socialise amongst yourselves to have
          a memorable experience. I sincerely encourage all participants to speak up during 
           the conference and to defend their allocated country/person and contribute in 
           establishing peace in the world (although I will try my best to destroy that during Crisis).

      Greetings, my name is Saurav Talukdar, and I am delighted and honoured to serve as 
      the USG of chairing of Earth Ignite. After participating in Model UNs for almost three 
      years, I've realised that what I truly enjoy are the conversations and the memories I've
       built along the wayâ€”not the accolades, the flawless resolutions, or the countless ROPS. 
       Having participated at over 20 events, my MUN journey has been the most remarkable. With 
       that, I sincerely hope that everyone will have an incredible time at Earth Ignite. I hope to 
       see everyone there!</p>

    <p><br>
      Ciao! If I had to describe myself in one sentence, it would be the Confucian quote 'Wherever you go, go with all your heart.'
       I'm Ann Mary Joseph, a ninth grader at the Indian High School Dubai, and I'm honoured to be serving as your USG for Delegate
        Affairs at this year's Earth Ignite. Having been an avid reader and debater for most of my years, MUN intrigued me beyond 
        words. I always thought of MUN as 'putting the power where the ambition lies,' because when I saw the infectious enthusiasm
         and boundless curiosity that delegates like you brought, I couldn't be more inspired! Debates, opinions and the joy of 
         sharing have been such a catalyst for change in my life, and I endeavour to bring you all a little bit of that magic as 
         your USG this year. I am also a STEM enthusiast, and an ambitious innovator, with an insatiable curiosity, constantly 
         finding new topics to wonder about, things to tinker with, and problems to solve. Feel free to reach out to me anytime 
         should you need anything with regards to this MUN, and I hope to see you all in November and make this MUN one to remember
          for you all, filled with new friends, experiences and memories for a lifetime.    </p>
